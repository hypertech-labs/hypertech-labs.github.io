<p>If you're an amateur astronomer looking to get started, I recommend first (while you're planning your night), visit this website: <a target="new" href="https://www.darkskymap.com/nightSkyBrightness">Dark Sky Map Website</a> and find a nice dark sky area near you. Designated Dark Sky Areas are specifically chosen for their lack of light pollution, trees/hills, and having a good high up viewpoint nearby, which makes it good for astronomy.</p>
<p>Once you have found a nearby area, check this weather website (which is specifically for the use of astronomers):<a target="new" href="https://clearoutside.com/forecast/50.7/-3.52">ClearOutside Weather Forecast Website</a>. When you are ready to go, no matter the time of year, I would recommend wearing or at least bringing with you several warm layers to wear. Plus, if you are in possession of a thermal drinks flask, then perhaps think about filling it with some kind of hot beverage to keep you going.</p>
<p>Now, if you are an amateur who is just starting, you may not have any kind of equipment, but even a simple pair of birdwatching binoculars can enhance your view beautifully. Or you can simply turn up with a smartphone and yourself, and use your eyes as your telescope. 
<p>To prepare, you could always check the Bortle Scale Rating (a measure of light pollution) for the area that you are deciding to visit in order to do some stargazing. The higher the Bortle Number, the more light pollution there is. Just for comparison, the Bortle Number for London tends to generally be 8 or 9 (9 being the highest), whereas the more rural areas of Cornwall are more like 2 or 3. To have a good view of the night sky, the Bortle Number generally needs to be 5 or less. Bear this in mind while you check the Bortle Ratings for your designated stargazing site.</p>
